# GCP Cloud Functions - Go Starter

#### Features:

- **funcFramework** already set up - ready for local development and testing.
- **Hot Reload** ready-to-go thanks to the [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) library. Just download the binary straight from the [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) repo, or run the docker image (it's already set up - just run `docker-compose up`)

#### Usage:

1. **Hot Reload Setup**:
   **Option 1: Docker** - run `docker-compose up` to start the server using the air docker image for hot reload.
   **Option 2: Air Binary** - directly download the binary from the [Air repo](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air). Then run `make start` to run the start script inside our `Makefile` (it just runs the command `air`.)
2. Edit as you need!
